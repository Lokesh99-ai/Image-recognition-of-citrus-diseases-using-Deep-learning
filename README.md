# Image-recognition-of-citrus-diseases-using-Deep-learning
In recent times, with the improvement of machine learning and deep-learning
methods.It's possible to perceive and identify citrus diseases by using these principles of machine
and deep learning. In this project Image Recognition of Citrus Disease is carried forward using the
principles of convolutional neural network(CNN). The image dataset includes four common citrus
sicknesses Blackspot,Canker,Greening,Scab.The deep learning network is used to teach/train
,understand and analyze these images.
